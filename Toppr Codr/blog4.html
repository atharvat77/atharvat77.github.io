                <p>On the dark and cold night of December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old woman was brutally assaulted and raped in a moving bus in south Delhi. Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old female physiotherapy intern was beaten, gang-raped, and tortured on December 16, 2012, in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South Delhi. She was travelling with her friend, Awindra Pratap Pandey.</p>
                <p>The woman and her friend Pandey were returning home after watching the movie "Life of Pi" on the night of December 16, 2012. They boarded an off-duty charter bus at Munirka bus stand in which there were six other men including the bus driver. The bus started moving in an off-route direction and the men shut the doors of the vehicle. Suspecting something wrong, when Pandey raised an objection, he was shouted down and a scuffle broke out as the men who were drunk started molesting her. Her friend was knocked down with a rod and the men dragged her to the back of the bus and repeatedly gang-raped for over an hour. As she fought back, one of the juvenile attackers inserted an iron rod into her private parts, pulling and ripping her intestines apart. The bus driver drove all over Delhi while this was happening. After the attack, both of them were thrown out of the bus to die at the side of the road. The two were found half-dead by a passerby who informed the Delhi Police. She was taken to the Safdarjung Hospital where doctors found she had only five per cent intestines left inside her body. She succumbed to her injuries on December 29, 2012. In her statement to Police, she said she wanted justice against the six attackers. The incident led to widespread demonstrations and protests across the country. It also started changes in the laws about violence against women.</p>
                <p>All the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case were executed on Friday (March 20) at 5.30 am hours after the Supreme Court and the trial court rejected their last-minute plea against their sentence, ending their bid to stave off the final fate.</p>
