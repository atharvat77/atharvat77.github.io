                <p>On the night of 26 November 2008, 10 Pakistan-based terrorists entered the Mumbai via sea route, carrying out attacks at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, the Oberoi Trident hotel, the luxurious Taj Mahal Hotel, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital and the Nariman House Jewish community centre.</p>
                <p>11 years since the horrific 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai that claimed the lives of about 200, including security personnel, civillians, and hotel staff, here is a look at some of the bravest who put the safety of others before their own.</p>
                <p>ATS Chief Hemant Karkare defended Mumbai till his last breath until terrorists Kasab and Ismail opened fire outside the Cama Hospital. Encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar was killed by bullets fired by Kasab as per his confession post-capture. Senior police office Ashok Kamte was the third brave life lost along with Karkare and Salaskar outside the Cama Hospital. All three were posthumously awarded Ashok Chakras for their bravery and dedication to defend the city of Mumbai until their dying breath. It was because of assistant sub-inspector Tukaram Omble's selfless sacrifice that Kasab became the only terrorist from the attacks to be captured, and later, hanged.Team commander of 51 Special Action Group, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan defended his fellow commandos and guests trapped in the Taj Hotel until he was shot dead. His reported last words, "Do not come up, I will handle them" were as heroic as his actions in Operation Black Tornado. He was also posthumously awarded the Ashok Chakra. Karambir Singh Kang, the general manager of the Taj hotel, supervised the evacuation of guests from the hotel despite losing his own wife and son who were trapped in the hotel's 6th floor.</p>

                <h4>The sacrifices of our real heroes did not go in vain. All the terrorists were killed except one who was later hanged. The bravery and patriotism and sense of duty defeated the evil plans of the terrorist and once again reiterated the line ETERNAL TRIUMPH OF GOOD OVER EVIL</h4>
